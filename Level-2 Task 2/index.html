                    time, Haider promised himself to establish her singing career in Bollywood. He even said to the
                    producer that, one day will come when all the producers and directors will fall on her feet and beg
                    her to sing in their films. </li>

                    1948 and 1974. Mohammed Rafi contested the statistics, and after 1991 the record was discontinued
                    from the Guinness Book of Records.</li>
